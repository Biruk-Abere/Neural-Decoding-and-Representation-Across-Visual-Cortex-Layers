**Abstract**:- We applied neural decoding techniques to the Allen Brain Observatory dataset to assess the decoding accuracy of various visual features, such as orientation, spatial frequency, and motion direction, across different layers of the Visual Cortex. This analysis revealed that certain layers exhibit higher decoding accuracy for specific visual features/stimuli, suggesting functional specialization within the Visp region. By analyzing patterns of neural activity and the contributions of individual neurons in specialized layers, we identified specific neural populations crucial for encoding particular visual features or stimuli. To achieve this, we utilized techniques such as dimensionality reduction and sparse coding analysis, which helped uncover the critical neural representations responsible for processing relevant visual information.
